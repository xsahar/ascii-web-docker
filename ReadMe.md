# ASCII-ART-WEB-Stylize

## Project Description

The ASCII Art Dockerizer project is a containerized version of the ASCII Art Web application. It packages all the necessary components, dependencies, and configurations into a Docker image, making it portable and easy to deploy. Docker provides benefits such as portability, isolation, scalability, versioning, and simplified deployment, allowing the ASCII Art Web application to run consistently across different environments.

## Features

- Containerization: The ASCII Art Docker project packages the ASCII Art Web application into a Docker container, ensuring portability, isolation, and consistent execution across different environments.

- Scalability and Deployment: By leveraging Docker, the project enables horizontal scaling and simplified deployment of the ASCII Art Web application, allowing for efficient load balancing and easy distribution across Docker-supported hosts.

- Versioning and Management: Docker's versioning capabilities facilitate easy management and tracking of different releases of the ASCII Art Docker project, enabling seamless updates and rollbacks when needed.

## Installation
Ensure that Docker is installed on your computer. If it isn't already, you can download and install it from the official[ hhtp://Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). Once Docker is installed, ensure that you also install the Docker extension in your Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor.

## Cleanup

It's essential to be cautious of unused objects, commonly referred to as "garbage collection." To address this, the project incorporates a executable file called clean.sh, designed specifically to handle any unused images and containers. This allows for efficient management and cleanup of resources that are no longer needed.
